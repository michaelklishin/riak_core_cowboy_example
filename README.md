# Cowboy Riak Core VNode Dispatcher

This was once a port of Jon Brisbin's [Misultin Riak Core VNode dispatcher example](https://github.com/jbrisbin/misultin-riak-core-vnode-dispatcher) to [Cowboy](http://github.com/extend/cowboy).

The example is **6 years old** and therefore is terribly out of date. And it was not a great
efficiency example to begin with. The author would recommend against using it.
